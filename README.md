Where:

D_m = mth differentiated payment;

P = the credit principal;

i = nominal (monthly) interest rate. it’s a floating value, 1/12 of the annual interest rate. For example, if the annual interest rate = 12%, then i = 0.01.

n = Number of payments. Usually, it’s the count of months.

m = current period (month).
